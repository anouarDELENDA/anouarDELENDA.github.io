> <p style="text-align:justify;"> In this work, I aim to span a various Machine Learning models; especially the regression ones. And the goal is to select the most promissing model that can predict in a smart fashion the Atomization energy of a given molecular structure. The Data can be found in the DataBase called GDB−13, also it is available under the name <code>roboBohr</code> as <code>csv</code> file format in kaggle's Dataset <code>energy-molecule</code> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/delendaanouarakacha/model-selection-for-atomization-energy-prediction">Read more...</a></p>

> <p style="text-align:justify;"> The <b>Ptychography</b> is a microscopy tool to investigate the crystal structure, this idea started in the lately sixties (1969) by Walter Hoppe. And by the growth of the computational power it start to gain more attention in 1982. The main concept addressed by this method is to reconstruct a crystal structure. Emerging the Ptychography into spectroscopy can be done by changing the problem from spatial-reciprocal space representation to time-frequency description. <a href="">Read more...</a></p>

> <p style="text-align:justify;"> The aim of this work is to explain in a decent way the most used method to evaluate electronic structure proprieties of any compounds. Mainly within the frame work of this topic we targeted the semiconductors (Si and Ge) and Carbon for the sake of diversity. The latter method is refers to Tight Binding approach. Furthermore, We introduced the theoretical formalism in more simplified way, where we focus to break down the complexity of the problem. We were also interested to evaluate the Density of state using the Linear Tetrahedron Method. <a href="">Read more...</a></p>
